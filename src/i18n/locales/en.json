The Vue.js application was responsible for interfacing with the Laravel back-end and presenting the data in a user-friendly manner. The application allowed users to create profiles, manage their feeds, and interact with other users on the social platform. Overall, the project required a strong understanding of database technology, API development, and front-end development.
